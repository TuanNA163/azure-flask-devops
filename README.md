# Overview
An overview of the project
In this project, We will build a Github repository from scatch and create a scaffolding in performing
both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delevery.
 1. Using Github Actions along with a Makefile, requirements.txt and application code to perform an initial lint, test, and install cycle.
 2. Integrating this project with Azure Pipelines to enable Continuous Delivery to Azure App Service.
 3. Using Azure Cloud shell in this project

* Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell.  [Use this file as a template for the deployed prediction]([(https://github.com/TuanNA163/flask-learn-udacity/blob/main/make_predict_azure_app.sh)]).
The output should look similar to this:


## Make prediction
```bash
udacity@Azure:~$ ./make_predict_azure_app.sh
